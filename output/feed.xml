Before attempting to post please read the rules. We don’t appreciate scalpers here and the risk of random people scamming people for tickets is very real on Reddit so we don’t allow private ticket sales to protect everyone here.

ANY ALTERNATIVES??!!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1ptacql/i_was_done_with_coda_and_now_with_dprtmnt_any/</link><description>TLDR: Tired of CODA and DPRTMNT's Management cramping people inside the club. Alternative suggestions will be highly appreciated 🙏 PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST REBEL, VERTIGO OR COMFORT ZONE. _____________________________________________________________ I attended CODA for quite some time until they started allowing anyone in, regardless of capacity. My breaking point with CODA was when they booked PLEASUREKRAFT (one of my favourite DJs) on Jun. 7 (super excited about it!), but then they paired him with 3 other DJs who had nothing in common with his style. RESULT: the 2nd half of the night was a cramped Frankenstein set of 4 DJs with "4 different levels of skill sets." On top of that, there was almost no space to dance or walk. Despite having some decent talent here and there on other dates, I decided never go back again. Then, thanks to the excellent sound system, I thought DPRTMNT was the place to be, and it was for quite some time, then at some point later this year, their bad management changed my opinion on this club: Deborah de Luca, Friday, Nov. 21st - OVERSOLD - NO PLACE TO DANCE OR WALK Markus Schulz, Friday, Dec. 19th - OVERSOLD - NO PLACE TO DANCE OR WALK Markus Schulz is one of my favourite DJs, but DPRTMNT's awful management completely ruined the experience. You could not comfortably walk around the club. At some point, the coat check ran out of capacity as well, and you could see people on the dancefloor holding their winter gear in their hands. To make things worse, you could see and feel 3 notoriously annoying kinds of people in the club:  People who pushed their way across the crowd instead of walking along the borders, on the left and right sides of the dance floor. People and Groups STANDING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DANCE FLOOR WITHOUT MOVING - NO DANCING AT ALL, SOME WITH ALCOHOLIC DRINKS IN HAND, thus spilling their drinks and killing the vibe for everyone around them. Seriously, IF YOU CAN'T/DON'T WANT TO DANCE, F**K OFF AND DON'T COME TO AN EDM CLUB. AND IF YOU GET A DRINK, FINISH IT OFF THE DANCEFLOOR. The most asinine of all, individuals trying to force their way against a mass of fans congregated near the DJ booth. Literally, picture a person trying for several minutes to walk through a solid wall of concrete.  Like, Come On! I know club owners want to make as much money as possible, but not at the expense of providing a shitty experience to club-goers. HIKE THE PRICE IF YOU WANT, but DO NOT CRAMP PEOPLE INSIDE THE CLUB to the point that you even run out of coat check capacity. There shouldn't be much cost to implement a computerized counting system to determine how many people are inside the club at any given moment, so they stop letting people in when they reach capacity, and let people in again only when some of them have left. These are common practices at clubs in other big cities, and I believe even CODA had this at some point. I think it's time for Toronto to have a nightclub owner who is serious about providing a top-notch experience, if possible, with a bar that only sells water and redbull. I'm sure this will get rid of a bunch of undesirables who shouldn't be at the EDM-nightclub/RAVE scene. The only club I've seen in Canada with these common-sense practices, even going to the extent of putting up signs saying that cellphones are not allowed on the dance floor, is STEREO in Montreal. It's no surprise that there are Global DJs who prefer going to Montreal and avoid Toronto despite the 2 cities being so close to each other. PLEASE HELP! I know there are people in Toronto with more experience than I have. If you could please provide alternative places to go or event organizers who don't engage in these practices, it will be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long rant and many thanks! 🙏    submitted by    /u/Usual-Fuel8166   [link]   [comments]</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1ptacql/i_was_done_with_coda_and_now_with_dprtmnt_any/</guid></item><item><title>Boxing Day Recommendations?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pttry7/boxing_day_recommendations/</link><description>Where to go dance?

I’m wondering if there are any upcoming hardstyle events, festivals, or similar raves happening around Toronto or nearby? Back in Australia we had big rave groups like HSU (Hard Styles United) are there any major promoters or rave collectives here that are worth following? Also, what’s the rave scene like here in general? Curious how it compares and where people usually go for harder styles. Appreciate any recommendations, pages to follow, or general tips. Thanks! 🙏    submitted by    /u/crazy_chopper   [link]   [comments]</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1ptkmh6/upcoming_hardstyle_or_similar_events/</guid></item><item><title>Deadmau5 at Rebel on the 26th!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt7frt/deadmau5_at_rebel_on_the_26th/</link><description>New to the city, are we expecting a wave of chaos or is there a chance this will be a PLUR +ve event. Also, stubhub has these tickets at 165 (excl. taxes) per person - is it worth it at this price point? Is there merit in waiting to see if it drops closer to the event.    submitted by    /u/freedloop   [link]   [comments]</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt7frt/deadmau5_at_rebel_on_the_26th/</guid></item><item><title>First Rave!</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt0uci/first_rave/</link><description>Had an amazing experience for my first time. Went to the raven on Saturday night and rotated to vertigo around 2. I feel like I vibed much more with the music and energy at the raven (I believe it was called Hard x Acid) vs at vertigo. Also really enjoyed vertigo as a venue but it became a bit club-y as the night went on (just the energy and crowd, idm but it’s not for me tbh) so I’m looking for see what events yall are going to this week through NYE. My friend suggested Coda but she also said it can be hit or miss depending on the night. Also if anyone has a hard techno playlist on either AM or spotify link me plsss would appreciate it af  Thanks in advance!!!    submitted by    /u/rafa6599   [link]   [comments]</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt0uci/first_rave/</guid></item><item><title>Boxing Day Parties</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt46tf/boxing_day_parties/</link><description>Any good parties happening the weekend of the 26th/27th?     submitted by    /u/Glad_Reception_6854   [link]   [comments]</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt46tf/boxing_day_parties/</guid></item><item><title>anyone going to this rave?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1pt92kc/anyone_going_to_this_rave/</link><description>The NYE blizzard rave at OCR pursuit is on my list of options for what to do on NYE.
