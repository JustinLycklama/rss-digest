Underground spots are packed, international DJs are flying in, and the community vibe feels stronger each weekend. Even with bigger crowds, the scene still has that inclusive, electric feel that makes Toronto special. If this momentum keeps up, 2025 could go down as one of the best years for raves in the city.

That’s the recession + geopolitical tension effect. The harsher the world, the more euphoric the music scene (at least up until the point of actual oppression). Gotta fight for your right to party.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">1nofjp4</guid></item><item><title>John 00 Flemming is back baby for All Night Long!</title><link>https://reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1noifly/john_00_flemming_is_back_baby_for_all_night_long/</link><description>For the uninitiated, J00F is a legend known for his deep dark hypnotic sound and marathon sets. 

The night starts off chill but as the hours go by, it gets deeper, darker and harder as you journey through trance, techno and psy. His longest set in Toronto was ~10 hours a few years back.

He has loads of sets for you to check out but Imo his peak content is his covid lockdown steams

TLDR : Hiiiiiiighly recommended. Not afiliated with organizer or anything, just someone who has seen him play 13+ times.

I missed him and Lawrence last time they were here. Not going to miss the J00F this time.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">1noifly</guid></item><item><title>Craving more Hardstyle in Toronto and need some tips!</title><link>https://reddit.com/r/TorontoRaves/comments/1nopwga/craving_more_hardstyle_in_toronto_and_need_some/</link><description>Yo! 

I've been falling in love with hardstyle and hard techno recently (just saw Holy Priest last week omg such a insane show) and need more events with that kind of energy! I've got my tickets for Coone on Nov 1st but I need something to hold me over for the weekends before then! Any recommendations for this weekend or next weekend?

(Also I just wanted to mention how amazing as a community every one of you are, I'm new to raving but love to dance and I feel so comfortable going crazy at these events because of all of your good vibes!)

Pretty sure off-Sojourn is gonna be mostly techno, dnb and other heavy shit.


Plus the sojourn vibe + crowd is usually great!



Going on this Friday 26 from 10pm-5am
