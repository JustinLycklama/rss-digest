Before attempting to post please read the rules. We don’t appreciate scalpers here and the risk of random people scamming people for tickets is very real on Reddit so we don’t allow private ticket sales to protect everyone here. Thank you 😊    submitted by    /u/said__with__sarcasm   [link]   [comments]&lt;/p&gt;

It was my first time, I don’t love buddies as a venue and feel like they oversold and were way understaffed.  We had tickets and arrived at 12, the line had become jumbled between people with tickets and without and they seemed so overwhelmed trying to manage it. They only had two people at the door, two people doing coat check, and not enough staff cleaning/managing the chaos with broken glass on the floor in several locations. Ahead of time I saw online they would have harm reduction folks and security in pink roaming to help people but I only saw one woman in a pink sweater, was not enough of a presence for a crowd this big. I really felt for the staff who seemed to be working so hard but just could not handle it.  Took an hour to get it. Once inside the vibes were good and it was fun having two djs and rooms but coat check was so overwhelmed they stopped taking coats for 45 minutes. We finally we able to coat check around 2 am, and then had a blast and danced a lot. The djs were awesome.  We tried to leave around 3:30, thinking I didn’t want to stay till 4 am when coat check would be slammed, but too late. The line was a mess and it weaved around into the bathroom which was so hot and disgusting. I even flagged to the staff if they could organize the line better but they didn’t. We waited another hour + to get our coats, didn’t leave till nearly 5 am.  Crowd was more diverse than a usual gay bar in the village, age, race, and gender wise, which is really nice as that’s what I’m looking for, but still predominantly gay men with what seemed like a lot of cruising in dark corners. No hate to that at all, love that gay men are able to do so, but was hoping for a bit more of a we are here to dance vibe.  Anyways just curious if others attended who have been to other ones how it compares, I think this is the first time it’s been at buddies? Most people I talked to it was their first one so they couldn’t compare it. Is it always this hectic or am I right that they weren’t well prepared?     submitted by    /u/BadCitation   [link]   [comments]&lt;/p&gt;
