How would this distance have been measured?</title><link>https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nmi6s0/eratostenes_famously_calculated_the_size_of_the/</link><description>Google Maps thinks it's about a 1000km walk (to Aswan, the modern day location of Syene), but that number alone wouldn't have been enough for Erato (as his friends call him), since I assume he'd have needed the distance between their latitudes ([sketched a mockup here](https://i.imgur.com/haKR8Yj.png)).

How would this measurement have been performed? Was it something Eratostenes would have commissioned specifically for this experiment? Do we know what number he ended up on to use in his final calculation and how it compares to the real value?
