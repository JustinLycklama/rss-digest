Looking to get into some ravey fun at Nuit Blanche this year, what events does everyone suggest? Just got back from Harvest Festival and would LOVE to see if any DJs from Harvest are playing anywhere. Definitely prefer outdoor venues as we like to spin the flow toys so we appreciate the space. I believe Acid Reign usually does the renegade one, and then the larger official one at Queens Park (but I donâ€™t recall who puts that on and canâ€™t find a DJ schedule). Help a girl out with some suggestions! Thanks ðŸ˜¸

Not sure about harvest dj's specifically but a lot of that crowd and vibe will be found at Queens park. Which likely will not have any official organization / lineup etc., due to nobody wanting to take responsibility for whatever happens there &amp; because it's a few disjointed small setups that don't really coordinate prior...  :)</description><guid isPermaLink="true">1nnz15x</guid></item><item><title>In Toronto for oct 2nd.
